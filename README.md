Rules:

Solve the levels one by one , the deciphered text or the key for that particular level is the password for the next level(archive).

-Same rule applies for all the levels regardless of stages.For example the key found in Stage 1: Level 1 would be the password for Stage 2: Level 2.

-Verify the keys by trying to open the next respective archive, if it opens its the right flag!! Else try again.

-Password for Stage 3 is the flag from Stage 2:Level 3, only one level in stage in Stage 3.

-Softwares folder contains the softwares which will be needed to solve some of the Levels.

-Clues are given in the Comment section of the archives(rar files).
